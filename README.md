# AerialCommunity

This repository hosts the community videos that have been donated for use in the Aerial project. 

**Note:** The usage of these videos may be restricted in some ways, we recommend you check the `license.txt` available with each source before doing something else with them. 

## Can I have my videos featured in Aerial?

There are two options right now for you to have your own videos in Aerial, you can either [create your own source](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCommunity/blob/master/CreatingASource.md) that you will be distributing yourself, or submit your videos to be included with the Community Videos. In that case, if they are accepted, they will appear for every Aerial user. 

**Warning:** While we welcome videos, we ask that they follow some artistic and technical guidelines. While you may use Aerial to, in the example of a tourism association, promote your city/country, we ask that you respect Aerial users by providing content that is, broadly, in the vein of what they would expect (beautiful aerial videos of landscapes/cityscapes). Promoting locations by showing their beauty: very welcome. Promoting a brand: very much not. 

Some broad rules about content:
- **Absolutely** no logo.
- Descriptive captions. You can provide captions that describe the scene. **They are not a direct marketing avenue/call to action**. 
- Good looking videos that would look at home in Aerial (usually, a travelling shot, can be from a drone, stabilized, and at a not too rapid pace. Usually 45seconds  to 3 mins being a good compromise for length). 
- Be selective about your content. We try to limit each new community source to a reasonable amount of videos (no more than 20 at first, less is fine !).

Some technical details: 
- You can provide your videos in multiple formats, in 1080p/4k, including HDR (Dolby Vision). The rule of thumb is, they must play in QuickTime on your Mac to be able to be played in Aerial. We do have some scripts and recommendations for encoding, if that helps.  
- At minimum, a 1080p H.264 version is **required**, we recommend you also provide your content in 4K if possible.
- At the moment, hosting looks possible on GitHub for the video files. You may still host the video files yourself if you wish. 

Undertand that this is a curated list and that there's no guarantee of inclusion. As stated above, you have the opportunity to create your own source (see [here for the technical details](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCommunity/blob/master/CreatingASource.md)). If you want to see your videos added here, please open an issue above. And *first* please read below. 

Most important rule:
- **Be nice:** Aerial is an open-source project that I develop and maintain on my free, limited, time. So please, be nice.
